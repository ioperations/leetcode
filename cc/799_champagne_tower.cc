/**
 * We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second
 * row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup
 * of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.
 * When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to
 * the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become
 * full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those
 * glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall
 * on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top
 * most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses
 * on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured,
 * those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four
 * cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full,
 * and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.
 *
 * Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how
 * full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)
