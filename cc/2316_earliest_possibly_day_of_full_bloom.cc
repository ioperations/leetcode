/*You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin
to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a
seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of
length n each:

plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed.
Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on
planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not
complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.
growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being
completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and
stays bloomed forever. From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in
any order.

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.*/

        This solution employs plot-based (visual) calculation of total time.
        Time complexity is logarithmic: O(N*logN). Space complexity is linear:
        O(N).

        Comments. The approach relies on the following strategy.

        It is straightforward that the answer can not be less than T0 =
        sum(plantTime) + min(growTime). Thus, for optimal strategy, the plant
        with minimal growth time should be planted last. Now, we're left with
        n-1 plants where the same logic applies. Thus, we come to a conclusion
        that plants should be planted according to the reverse-sorted list of
        growth time. Now let's count time. Is T0 the final answer? No, it might
        so happen, that on each iteration the time accumulated on previous steps
        surpasses the contribution from the current step. Thus, we need to
        account for this by taking appropriate max-values. To VISUALLY calculate
        the minimal time according the strategy above, just run this code that
        will basically plot the timeline. The length of the longest string is
        the answer.

        produces the following output:
