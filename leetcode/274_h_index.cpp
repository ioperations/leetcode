/*Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the
researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h
if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h
papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the
h-index.*/
